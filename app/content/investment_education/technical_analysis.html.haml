      %h1 What is Technical Analysis?
      =image_tag  "investment_education/TechnicalAnalysis.png", :width => "250px", :height => "200px"
      %p Technical analysis is a method of security analysis in which future movements in the price of a security are predicted by examining some patterns or trends that are obtained from the analysis of past market data.
      %p Technical analysis differs from fundamental analysis in that it does not attempt to analyze companies, industries or economies but simply treats prices as sets of data with hidden patterns in them. It is concerned with the idea of predicting trends and price movements due to changes in the demand and supply in the market.
      %p Technical analysts attempt to make use of their predicted price trends to profit.

      %h1 Assumptions in Technical Analysis:
      =image_tag  "investment_education/TechnicalAnalysis2.png"
      %ol
        %li Market Demand and Supply Determines Price
        Technical analysts assume that the market price of a security is determined by the market demand and supply, which is in turn affected by factors that can be rational or irrational. In economics, we learn that the point at which the demand curve intersects the supply curve is the equilibrium point determined by the market. This equilibrium point reflects the current price set by the market, as well as the quantity of goods demanded at this particular price.
        A particular direction in which the price moves denotes a trend, and this is determined by changes in market demand and supply. They believe that it is possible to detect future changes in the market demand and supply by analyzing the market itself.
        %li Price Movements Always Reflect Trends That Persist.
        =image_tag  "investment_education/TechnicalAnalysis3.png"
        %p Technical analysts believe that the prices of securities always exhibit trends that persist for a period of time. In technical analysis, we can plot charts showing the historical prices of all securities.
        %p From these charts, we see a price pattern, where prices tend to go up for a period of time before reversing in direction, and, staying there for a period of time. From this persistence in the direction of prices, analysts will be able to obtain a trend line, which they use to predict the future direction of prices.
        %p How do traders apply technical analysis in their daily trading activities? Market traders enter the market at the beginning of the trend and attempt to exit before a trend reversal. For example, if a trader predicts a bullish trend, it means that he expects prices to keep increasing over the next few days. The trend-line that he plots may be characterized by a series of increasing peaks.
        =image_tag  "investment_education/TechnicalAnalysis4.png", :height => "200px"
        %p To exploit this trend, he will buy into a particular stock at the beginning of the trend, when prices are increasing but not exorbitantly high, and subsequently exit this trade nearing the end of the trend, before prices begin to fall.
        %p In doing so, there is no need for information on the fundamentals of securities, such as the business model, management strategies or financial statements, in order to value these securities. This is one important advantage of technical analysis that makes it popular over fundamental analysis.
        %p Of course, randomness in trends is related to a concept known as the Efficient Market Hypothesis. Technical analysis has attracted a fair number of critics because of this major assumption that it makes. More on this will be covered in the section on Advanced Technical Analysis.
        %li History Repeats Itself
        =image_tag  "investment_education/TechnicalAnalysis5.png"
        %p Technical analysts assume that the markets are reflections of human psychology, which has remained largely the same throughout the history of mankind. In other words, how people respond to changes around them tend to remain the same throughout history.
        %p In the financial markets, people have different emotions and risk tolerance. However, all of them are equally motivated by profits and they are likely to react the same way in response to situations. For example, news of an impending recession and falling growth will result in a fall in stock prices worldwide.
        %p This is because most people become anxious about their future returns on investments, resulting in a massive sale of securities.
        %li The market takes into account everything
        %p Technical analysts assume that the stock price of a company (shown in a stock index) is the true value of the stock because the market has already priced in all factors, as well as the magnitude of impact of these factors on the company’s stock price. Such factors include the fundamentals of the company as well as other economic, social and political factors that may affect the company’s earnings.
        =image_tag  "investment_education/TechnicalAnalysis6.png"
        %p One obvious example of the market pricing in current economic, social and political factors will be the Deepwater Horizon oil spill which resulted from an explosion of an oil rig owned by the British Petroleum (BP) in the middle of 2010. This has resulted in the largest offshore oil spill in the history of the United States.
        %p The market had since then, reacted drastically to the news, causing a drastic fall in BP’s stock price, which fell half its value within weeks. There were many speculations as to whether the market was being irrational (meaning that BP would have been massively undervalued then) or that the market had reacted to reflect the true price of BP. Some experts noted that the large lawsuits from environmentalists, the government as well as local fishermen would potentially bankrupt BP, thus the plunge in market value was rational and correctly reflected BP’s future earnings.
        %p As we have seen, people tend to have the same response to events or economic and political changes. This is one reason why an important indicator that economists and market analysts use is the Consumer Confidence Index, especially in countries like the United States which depend heavily on consumer spending to boost their economy. Since human psychology is believed to remain the same throughout history, they believe that it is possible to study past market data in order to predict future directions in the market.
        %p Sometimes, human psychology may also manifest itself in the form of self-fulfilling prophecies. This means that if there are enough investors and traders who believe that the market will move in a certain direction, they act in a manner that this belief becomes a reality. For example, if enough number of people believe that the stock price of ABC Inc is going to fall, then they will all sell their stock. This leads to an increased supply of ABC stock in the market and cause the price of ABC stock to go down
        =image_tag  "investment_education/TechnicalAnalysis7.png"
        %p Somehow, nobody knows if something will happen. For example, nobody actually knows if a recession is coming but if enough people in a country start believing that a recession is looming, everyone will start to react in a way that reflects their belief.
        %p These people may, for instance, delay investments, sell their investment holdings, or reduce domestic and personal spending. When enough people start doing so and continue to do so for a period of time, the economy may actually slide into a recession simply because no one is spending or investing! In this case, people would have caused a recession because there were enough of them acting in a way that a widespread belief actually became  a reality.

      %h1 Simple Trends To Know:
      %p There are three basic trends that analysts try to find when plotting charts. Analysts try to plot trendlines by attempting to identify a pattern in the peaks and troughs of price curves.
      %p A peak is the highest point on a curve before it begins to fall and a trough is simply the lowest point on a curve before it begins to move upwards. The three types of trendlines are the downtrends, uptrends and horizontal/sideways trends. Obviously, a downtrend will indicate a bearish outlook and an uptrend will indicate a bullish outlook. The horizontal trend is ambiguous in that it does not clearly indicate any definite direction, whether up or down.
    %section
      %h1 Downtrends:
      =image_tag  "investment_education/TechnicalAnalysis9.png"
      %p A downtrend (shown above) is characterized by a series of falling peaks and falling troughs. The trendline can be plotted joining up the series of falling peaks or troughs as shown by the red arrow. It is obvious that the trend is falling because each successive peak is lower than the previous peak. Similarly, each successive trough is lower than the previous trough.
    %section
      %h1 Uptrends:
      %p
        In the diagram below, we see that an uptrend is characterized by a series of increasing peaks and increasing troughs.
        The plotted trendline is denoted by the red arrows on top of the peaks and below the troughs.
      %p In an uptrend, we will see that each successive peak is higher than the previous peak, and each successive trough lower than the previous trough.
      %p Horizontal Trends or Sideways Trends
      =image_tag  "investment_education/TechnicalAnalysis10.png"
      %p The horizontal (or some say “sideways”) trend is  characterized by a series of peaks and troughs that do not clearly show any direction, whether up or down.
      %p This trend shows ambiguity in the future direction of stock prices.
      %p This trend may indicate that the market is jittery, because prices are fluctuating up and down without indicating any particular direction. It may show that traders are currently unsure of the future direction in the economy and financial markets. Most people are probably taking a wait-and-see attitude.
      %p Technical analysts use of a combination of the following tools:
      %ol
        %li Technical Indicators: Technical indicators are mathematical values obtained from calculations involving price and volume data. For example, moving averages are weighted averages of security prices across a fixed time period, with weights determined by different weighting methods. Examples of moving averages are – simple moving averages, exponential moving averages etc. The calculation of technical indicators can get quite complex. Some other commonly used technical indicators are: Relative Strength Index, Moving Average Convergence Divergence, Average Directional index etc.
        %li Charts: Technical analysts tend to make heavy use of charts. They believe that visual patterns on charts repeat themselves over time. They attempt to identify such patterns and predict future movement of stock prices.
      %p Some common chart patterns are – Head and shoulders pattern, ascending triangle pattern, descending triangle pattern etc.
      %p It is the editor’s personal opinion that technical analysis should be used with extreme caution. He does not rely technical analysis to make investment decisions and prefers to base his decisions on fundamental analysis and merely use technical analysis for a “second opinion”.
