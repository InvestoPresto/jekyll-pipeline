      %h1 What does foreign exchange mean?
      =image_tag  "investment_education/ForeignExchange1.png"
      %p The foreign exchange(FX) market is a global financial market where currencies are traded over-the-counter. The term “over-the-counter” simply refers to a type of trading that occurs directly between the buyer and seller directly, rather than through an intermediary institution such as a stock exchange or  a futures exchange.
      %p The foreign exchange market is the largest, most liquid financial market in the world, trading 24 hours daily (except weekends) with a total transaction value of $ 3.2 trillion according to a 2007 survey.
      %p This number is incredible, especially since this is more than 5 times the volume of imports and exports around the world! So where did this number come from? In fact, a large percentage of foreign currency trading is carried out by financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan.

      %h1 Types of Foreign Currency Trading:
      =image_tag  "investment_education/ForeignExchange2.png"
      %p The foreign currency trading can take the form of several types of transactions such as spot currency trading, currency forward trading, currency futures trading and currency swap trading.
      %p Spot trading refers to the direct exchange of one currency for another. For example, 1 million US Dollars could be exchanged for 1.2 million Euro in a spot trade.
      %p Current market prices are determined by the forces of demand and supply in the market, which is in turn influenced by fundamental factors, as well as economic and political factors. The equilibrium point at which the market demand meets the market supply is the point which determines the current price and quantity demanded by the market. Spot transactions are usually completed within two days because that is the length of time required for a bank to transfer money. Futures and forward markets allows for the trading of legally-binding contracts whose values are linked to certain underlying assets. Futures and forwards allow traders the right and obligation to transact a pre-determined asset at a pre-determined price at a pre-determined time. Forward prices and futures prices are determined by factors such as interest rates, as well as the prices of the underlying assets.
      %p Swaps are over-the-counter transactions that are widely traded among financial institutions. Buyers will swap their loans that are denominated in a currency that they find undesirable, for similar-sized loans denominated in a currency that they desire. Financial institutions make use of such swap agreements to hedge their currency risk.
      %p For further information on futures and forwards, refer to the articles on #{link_to 'Futures', page_path('investment_education/futures1')} and #{link_to 'Forwards', page_path('investment_education/forwards')}

      %h1 Unique features:
      %ol
        %li Zero sum game: Foreign Exchange trading is a zero sum game. Suppose you were to buy 1 Euro$ for 1.2 US dollars today. If the exchange rate (USD/EUR) were to rise to $1.3, that would imply that the dollar has strengthened with respect to the Euro. That would however, also imply that the Euro has weakened with respect to the dollar. Therefore, if one currency appreciates with respect to the other, the latter has to weaken with respect to the former. If you were to hold equal amounts of all of the world’s currencies, your portfolio will not change in value ever!
        %li OTC market: Foreign Exchange transactions occur over the counter (OTC). That means that these transactions occur directly between counterparties and not over an exchange. Counterparties contact one another and trade directly with each other. Dealers (market-makers) are usually large banks that have an inventory of different currencies. They buy and sell currencies and trade with individual corporations, governments and each other.
        %li Trading: If individual investors wanted to trade foreign exchange, they would have to deal with brokers/market makers. Most individual investors trade FX online, with brokers such as FXCTM and Deutsche Bank.
        %li Volatility: The absolute volatility in the FX market is quite low. Thus, for meaningful returns, investors trade using large notional amounts or on margin. Margin trading involves the use of leverage to amplify gains/losses. This involves trading using borrowed money. Another alternative is to use derivatives such as FX options.

      %h1 Currency Pairs:
      =image_tag  "investment_education/foreignExchange-Advanced.png"
      %p Currencies are usually quoted in pairs, meaning that the price of one unit of one currency is quoted in terms of the number of units of the other currency. For example, the Japanese Yen can be quoted in terms of the US dollar as per the following:
      %p USD/JPY = 119.20. This means that an investor can get 1 US dollar in exchange for 119.20 Japanese yen. In this case, the currency on the left of a currency pair quote is known as the base currency and the currency on the right is known as the quoted currency.
      %p The most actively traded currency pairs in the world are:
      %ul
        %li USD/JPY
        %li EUR/USD ( Euro/ US dollar)
        %li GBP/USD ( British Pound/ US dollar)
        %li USD/CHF ( US dollar/ Swiss Franc).
    %section
      %h1 Direct and Indirect Quotations:
      %p In direct quotations, the currency pair is quoted such that the domestic currency is the base currency and the foreign currency is the quoted currency.
      %p In indirect quotations, the currency pair is quoted such that the foreign currency is the base currency and the domestic currency is the quoted currency.
      %p In the previous example, the currency pair is quoted as USD/JPY = 119.20. If the US dollar is the domestic currency, the currency pair USD/JPY = 119.20 will be a direct quote. This means that one US dollar can be bought or sold for 119.20 Japanese Yen. The indirect quote is simply its reciprocal, which is JPY/USD = 1/(119.20) = 0.008389. This means that one Japanese Yen can be bought or sold for 0.008389 US dollar.

      %h1 Market Quotations, European Terms and American Terms:
      =image_tag  "investment_education/ForeignExchange-Advanced2.png"
      %p The US currency, (sometimes called the greenback) is usually the international currency used in many overseas import/export transactions and trade transactions. As such, most currencies tend to be quoted such that the US dollar is the base currency, except for the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and the New Zealand Dollar.
      %p These four currencies are usually quoted as the base currencies instead: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, AUD/USD, and NZD/USD.
      %p If currency pairs are quoted in “European terms”, it will mean that the US dollar is the base currency while those currency pairs quoted in “American terms” will have the US dollar as the quoted currency. For example:
      European Terms: USD/CAD = 1.0598
      American Terms: CAD/USD = 0.94356

      %h1 Cross Exchange Rates:
      =image_tag  "investment_education/ForeignExchange-Advanced3.png"
      %p Cross currency quotes are currency pairs that are quoted without the US dollar. Since most currency pairs are quoted in terms of US dollar, it is possible to obtain a cross currency quote by combining both quotes.
      %p For example, it is possible for us to obtain a cross currency quote of CAD/JPY by combining the currency pairs of USD/CAD and USD/JPY as follows:
      USD/CAD = 1.0598
      USD/JPY = 119.20
      CAD/JPY = 1/(USD/CAD) * USD/JPY = 1/1.0598 * 119.20 = 112.472
      %p Thus the cross currency pair shows that we can either buy or sell one Canadian Dollar for 112.472 Japanese Yen.

      %h1 Bid-Offer Rates:
      =image_tag  "investment_education/ForeignExchange-Advanced4.png"
      %p Usually, when you go to a brokerage or a money-changer to change currencies, they would quote you buy and ask rates, or the bid-offer rates. The bid rate is the rate at which the brokerage will buy the currency from you, in other words, it is also the rate at which you will sell your currency to the brokerage. The offer rate is the rate at which the brokerage will sell the currency to you. Therefore, it is the rate at which you will buy your currency from the brokerage.
      %p Brokerages or money-changers will profit from the bid-ask spread, which is the difference between the bid-offer rate. Therefore, the offer rate will always be higher than the bid rate because the brokerage will buy the currency from you at a rate lower than the rate at which it will sell it to you or to another investor.
      %p For example, we have a typical bid-offer rate as follows:
      EUR/USD: 1.5767 – 1.5769
      %p The bid rate is usually quoted on the left and the offer rate will be on the right. This means that the bid rate for EUR/USD is 1.5767 and the offer rate is 1.5769.The brokerage will buy one Euro for 1.5767 USD from investors, and sell one Euro for 1.5769. In other words, you will buy one Euro for 1.5769 from your brokerage and sell one Euro for 1.5767.
      %p Usually, the bid and offer rates differ by only the last two digits as shown above. For convenience, brokerages will usually quote the bid-offer rates as follows: EUR/USD: 1.5767/69.
      %ul
        %li Currencies are usually quoted in pairs. For e.g. USD/JPY = 119.20. This means that an investor can get 1 US dollar in exchange for 119.20 Japanese yen
        %li Brokerages or money-changers will profit from the bid-ask spread, which is the difference between the bid-offer rate
