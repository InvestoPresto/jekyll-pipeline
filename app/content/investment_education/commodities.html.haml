        Commodities
        are goods which have no differentiation between them and which are identical no
        matter who produces them. For example, 24 carat gold is the same whether it is mined
        in South Africa, India or China. It is impossible to tell the difference between
        two barrels of Brent crude. Therefore, at any given point of time, two different
        barrels of Brent crude should sell at the same price, and so should 2 different
        bushels of wheat or 2 different ounces of gold. Commodities could be precious metals
        such as gold and silver, base metals such as lead, softs such as coffee and wheat
        or energy related such as crude oil etc. Even complex instruments such as options
        on freight contracts or weather are traded frequently.

      %h1 Why the interest in Commodities?
      =image_tag  "investment_education/comm6.png", :height => "190px", :width => "280px"
      %p
        Commodities,
        to the average layman, are considered raw materials that are used in the further
        processing and production of consumer goods. In recent years, we have seen countries
        like Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC nations) emerging to become significant
        players in the global economy. In order to support economic activities such as manufacturing,
        infrastructure and construction, these countries have driven up global demand, resulting
        in a dramatic increase in the prices of commodities. One important point to note
        is that commodities are real, non-financial assets, and they can be held physically.
      %p
        The actual price of a commodity that can be held physically is also known as the
        spot price. Since a commodity is a physical asset, there are some costs and benefits
        associated with buying the actual spot asset. Note that these do not apply to non-physical,
        financial assets such as stocks.

          %h1 Carrying costs:
          Take for example, you decide to invest in oil. In a transaction, you buy 1000 barrels
          of oil. However, once the physicals have been delivered to you, you will need to
          find a place to store all these barrels! Thus, in buying a spot asset, you will
          also incur storage costs, or carrying costs.
        %li
          %h1 Convenience benefits:
          Take the previous example and assume that you
          run a shipping firm. In an industry such as shipping, timeliness is extremely important
          to clients, and you would not want to make your customers wait. Thus, it will be
          good to have some oil on hand in case of emergency purposes. In such a case, holding
          the actual physical asset has its convenience benefits.

      %h1 Commodities Trading:
      =image_tag  "investment_education/comm4.png"
      %p
        Commodities are traded on commodity exchanges such as the Chicago Board of Trade
        (CBOT) or the Singapore Commodity Exchange (SICOM). The bulk of the commodity
        trading is done through derivatives such as
        Futures and Options
      %h1 Futures Contracts:
      %p
        A commodity future is a contract that gives the buyer
        the right and the obligation to buy or sell a certain quantity of that commodity
        at a particular price after a particular period of time.
      %p The futures price of a security is derived from its actual spot price. In other words, a futures contract is a type of derivative security because its value is derived from the value of an underlying asset. We will cover in detail how to derive this value in the article on futures.
      %p A commodity option gives the buyer the right but not the obligation to do the same. These futures and options can in turn, be traded. Traders can also trade in commodities without using futures or options. For example, I could buy 1 ton of cotton at X dollars and sell it a day later for a profit.
    %section
      %h1 How can individual investors trade commodities?
      %p It is not easy for small investors to trade commodities in general. Investors wanting exposure to oil or gold prices can trade Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that track the spot price of gold/oil such as the Benchmark Gold ETF (Gold) or the Macro Shares Oil Up ETF (Oil). Investors have to use options or futures traded on exchanges to get exposure to the prices of other commodities.
      %p Many investors who would like large exposures to commodity prices in a passive manner use collateralized futures positions. This involves the purchase of treasury bills or bonds and the simultaneous entering into a futures contract on the buy side. This position can be rolled over indefinitely as long as the collateral is sufficient to maintain the required maintenance margin.

      %h1 Advantages:
      =image_tag  "investment_education/comm5.png"
      %p
        Commodities are not well correlated with equities and could thus provide valuable #{link_to 'diversification', page_path('investment_education/diversification')} benefits. Commodities are considered good hedge against inflation because prices of commodities usually rises when inflation
        rate increase. This makes sense because inflation represents the changes in the
        general price level of selected physical goods in an economy, not excluding commodities
        which are simply spot physicals.
      %p
        In times of stable or slowing inflation rates, equities are better investments because
        equities are financial assets, and convertible into cash at some point in the future.
        If inflation rates are slowing, it will be better to obtain your investment returns
        in the form of cash since cash is expected to have more purchasing power. For example,
        in the case of an expected deflation, Rs.1 in cash which can buy you one loaf of bread
        today, may well buy you two loafs of bread in the future.
      %h1 Commission costs
      %p
        Associated with commodities is lower in comparison
        to other securities. It is always cheaper to buy derivatives and take positions
        on them rather than to buy the actual underlying asset.
    %section
      %h1 Disadvantages:
      %p
        For traditional commodities, a investor has to contact his broker for a deal. The
        broker then conveys the message to a pit, where the transaction is completed. However,
        this may be time consuming leading to loss of potential profit making chances.
      %p
        The futures price of a security is derived from its actual spot price. In other
        words, a futures contract is a type of derivative security because its value is
        derived from the value of an underlying asset. We will cover in detail how to derive
        this value in the article on futures. A commodity option gives the buyer the right
        but not the obligation to do the same. These futures and options can in turn, be
        traded. Traders can also trade in commodities without using futures or options.
        For example, I could buy 1 ton of cotton at X dollars and sell it a day later for
        a profit.
