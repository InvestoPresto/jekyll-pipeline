      %h1 What is a share (stock)?
      %p
        A share(stock) is defined as a part ownership of a company. Initially, shares  are sold by the owners of the company to the public in an Initial Public Offering,  generally  to finance the company’s expansion. After the Initial Public Offering (IPO), the shares are traded on an exchange such as the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) or National Stock Exchange (NSE), where an investor can purchase and sell shares. Small investors cannot transact directly with exchange. They need to open an account with a brokerage firm(e.g. Kotak Securities, ICICI Securities) which acts as an intermediary between the investor and the exchange.

            Capital Gain:
          Shares often appreciate in price over time. The difference between the purchase price and selling price of the shares is called capital gain. This is the main form of return from shares.

            Dividends:
          Companies often pay out a part of their profits to the shareholder. The share of profits which a company distributes to its shareholders is called dividend. Dividends are usually quite small are rarely yield over 2% p.a.
      %p
        The share price of a company is largely dictated by the company’s performance. If the company is performing well, the share price goes up.
        Similarly if the company performs poorly the share price goes down. Apart from company’s performance, the share price is also influenced by the trend and sentiment of the market.
        A positive sentiment and upward trend usually help to push the price up while a negative sentiment and downward trend may push the shares price down. Read our article on

      %h1 How risky are shares?
      %p
        Shares as an asset class are perhaps the riskiest amongst all asset classes. Further if a person was to be involved in trading as opposed to investing, the risk increases all the more. Consider this: During the 2008 subprime crisis, in spite of the Indian economy being insulated from most of the global mess, in no more than 14 months the share markets declined by more than 50% from their January 2008 highs. Later when the panic settled down, the equity markets rose by 100% from their March 2009 lows. During this time gold traded in a range between X-Y while your fixed deposits would have yielded you a standard Z% return. Also while the overall index declined by a little more than 50%, there were several shares that declined by more than 80%. Similarly in the run up too, several shares increased by 200-300% from their lows. To shield yourself from such extreme volatility, it is important you

      %p

Any holding for a period above 1 year is considered a long term and gains on it are exempt from tax. A holding period of less than a year is considered a short term and capital gains over the short term are subject to 15% short term capital gain tax.
