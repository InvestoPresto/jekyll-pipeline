      %h1 Taxation:
      %p
        Income earned from investments is usually taxable. The impact of taxes on investment returns can be substantial
        and can potentially play a significant role in investment strategy. It is possible to minimize the impact of
        taxes through tax-planning. Thus, all investors should understand the basics of taxation and the tax laws that apply to them.
    %section
      %h1 Marginal Tax Rate:
      %p The tax rate applicable to every additional rupee of income earned is called the marginal tax rate. If a country's tax rates are as follows:

      %h1 Tax on Dividends and Interests:
      =image_tag  "investment_education/tax1.png", :height => "138px", :width => "241px"
      %p
        Income earned as dividends from stocks or interest payments from #{link_to 'Bonds', page_path('investment_education/bonds')}, bank deposits etc is
        usually subject to taxation. The tax rate applicable depends on the tax structure of the country of which the investor is a
        resident. Some governments tax dividends and/or interest at a lower rate than other types of income, thereby giving investors the
        incentive to own stocks and/or interest bearing securities.
      %p For example, dividends are taxed at 15% p.a. in USA for most investors while dividends are not taxed at all in Hong Kong!
    %section
      %h1 Capital Gains Tax:
      =image_tag  "investment_education/tax2.png", :height => "216px", :width => "275px"
      %p
        As we have learnt in the article on stocks, increases in the value of an asset will result in capital gains.
        If a stock is purchased at Rs.10 and its value increases to Rs.15 over the course of 1 year, the total capital gain is Rs.5.
        If the investor sells this stock, the capital gain is considered a realized capital gain. If the investor continues to
        hold the stock at the end of the year, the capital gain is considered an unrealized capital gain.
        The tax payable on the capital gains realized when an investor sells assets (e.g. stocks) is called capital gains tax.
      %p
        Most countries tax capital gains at lower rates than other types of income.
        Realized and unrealized capital gains are usually taxed at different rates by most countries. In fact,
        most countries do not tax unrealized capital gains. Most countries also tax long term capital gains at
        a lower rate than short term capital gains.

      %h1 Comparing Interest/Dividend Taxes and Capital Gains Tax:
      %p
        Periodically, companies may reward their investors in times of high earnings. They may do so
        by paying out cash in the form of dividends or by repurchasing shares. Share repurchases refers
        to situations where the issuing company uses its own cash to buy a substantial number of its
        publicly traded shares off the market, thereby decreasing the pool of shares and increasing the
        price per share. Investors can thus, sell their shares in order to profit from this price increase.
        Thus, the company has indirectly made a payout to investors.
      %p
        While investing in stocks, investors may want to take into consideration the payout policy of the company.
        For example, large-cap companies (companies with large market capitalization) tend to pay out fixed dividends
        since they tend to be cash-rich. They are able to do so since they have reached a stage of stable growth.
        This is in contrast to smaller-cap companies that experience large fluctuations in earnings year-on-year and
        will need to retain some cash to plan for contingencies.

      %h1 Fun Facts!
      %p
        Many large corporations today have policies that their company managements receive part of their compensation packages in the form
        of stock options. Stock options will give option-holders the right to buy the underlying stock at a particular price. Thus, when the
        stock is currently trading at a high price, option-holders can exercise their option to buy at the pre-agreed price (which is lower
        than the current price). They will then sell the stock in the open market for a profit, which is simply is the difference between the
        option-holder’s purchase price and the current market price. When the company management is paid in the form of stock options, their
        pay is tied to the performance of the company.
      %p
        This means that since they will reap rewards when the value of the company’s stock increases. They should, in theory, work hard to
        ensure that the company performs well. Of course this also means that in selecting a payout policy, the company management will choose
        a share repurchase rather than a dividend payout since they will directly profit from the increase in share price. Further information
        can be found in the article on options

      %h1 Wealth Tax:
      =image_tag  "investment_education/tax4.png", :height => "216px", :width => "275px"
      %p
        Wealth tax is the tax imposed by some governments on the net assets of its citizens.
        Taxable wealth may include property, houses, #{link_to 'Stocks', page_path('investment_education/stocks')}, #{link_to 'Bonds', page_path('investment_education/bonds')} and other securities. The laws pertaining to wealth tax vary widely from country to country.
        Fortunately, wealth tax rates are generally much lower than income tax rates and are typically in the order of about 1% p.a. For example,
        the maximum wealth tax applicable in Switzerland is about 1.5% p.a. of net assets.

      %h1 Tax Drag:
      =image_tag  "investment_education/tax5.png", :height => "178px", :width => "247px"
      %p
        Tax drag is the decrease in possible income due to taxes. An example would best
        illustrate the concept of tax drag. here's an illustration:-
      %p
        Assume that a mutual fund yields 8% annually and that the income from the investment
        is re-invested in the same fund. Ashish Mishra invests Rs.100,000 in this mutual fund.
        Assuming that no taxes are applicable, his investment would be worth Rs.215,892 in
        10 years.
      %h1 calculation:
      %p ((1.08) ^ 10) X 100,000 = 215,892
      %p
        Suppose the income from mutual funds is taxed at 20%, Ashish would have a post-tax income
        of Rs.6,400 at the end of the first year and thus would only be able to re-invest
        the said amount at the end of the first year (As opposed to Rs.8000 assuming no taxes).
        This results in a reduction in the 2nd year’s income. The income lost is not only
        the tax paid but the potential interest that could be earned on the tax.
      %p
        The following table shows the income, tax paid and the future value of the investment
        in the scenario where there is no tax and in the scenario where there is a 20% tax
        payable every year.

      %h1 Tax Planning Strategies:
      %p
        It is possible to minimize the impact of taxes through careful planning. The following
        simple strategies can go a long way in minimizing tax drag:
      %p
        If unrealized capital gains are not taxed, delay selling your asset and
        realizing the capital gain for as long as possible. Do also consider the risk of
        the fall in market price before making your decision.
      %p
        Consider using a tax-deferred account such as a retirement account (available in some countries)
      %p
        Always use after-tax returns while making decisions about investments.
      %p
        In the event that long-term capital gains are tax exempt (e.g. India), consider
        holding stocks for long periods to avoid capital gains tax.
      %p
        Also consider tax-exempt #{link_to 'bonds', page_path('investment_education/bonds')} issued by your local government (e.g. some RBI bonds in India, certain Municipal
        bonds in USA)
