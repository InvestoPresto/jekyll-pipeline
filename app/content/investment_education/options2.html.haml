      %h1 Intrinsic Value of Options:
      =image_tag  "investment_education/Options-Advanced.png"
      %p 
        Assume the following:
        Rs.V represents the value of an underlying stock on the date at which the option contract is exercised
        Rs.X represents the strike price as indicated on the option contract.
      %ol
        %li
          Intrinsic value of Call option = Rs. Max [0, V – X]
          %p 
            A call option allows the option buyer the right to buy the stock at the strike price, Rs.X. The buyer will then sell this stock in the open market at the current trading price of Rs.V. His profit will thus, be Rs.(V – X). Thus, it is obvious that a call option buyer will only profit if Rs.V > Rs.X. This option contract is thus in-the-money as the buyer is profiting.
          %p
            Next, if the stock is currently trading below the strike price of the option, i.e. Rs.V<
            Rs.X. It makes no sense for the buyer to buy at a higher value on the option contract and sell it at a lower value in the open market. The call option will not be exercised and the options intrinsic value is Rs.0. The option is out-of-the-money.
          %p
            The option contract will not be exercised and the option’s intrinsic value is Rs.0. This option contract is considered out-of-the money.
          %p
        =image_tag  "investment_education/Options-Advanced2.png"
        %li Intrinsic value of Put option = Rs. Max [0, X – V]
        A put option allows the option buyer the right to sell the stock at the strike price, Rs.X. The buyer will then sell this stock at Rs.X, no matter what price the stock is currently trading at in the open market. His profit will thus be Rs.(X – V). Thus, it is obvious that the put option buyer will only profit if Rs.V<
        Rs.X. This put option is considered in-the-money.
        %p Next, suppose that the stock is currently trading above the strike price of the option i.e. Rs. V > Rs.X. It makes no sense for the option buyer to sell at a lower value when he can sell it in the open market at a higher value. The option contract will not be exercised and the options intrinsic value is Rs.0. The put option is considered out-of-the-money.
      %p 
        The minimum intrinsic value of an option is zero because the option contract will not be exercised if the investor expects a loss upon the exercise of the option. In this case, the seller will earn the option premium on selling the option and the buyer will make a loss on the premium paid to the seller.

      %h1 Calculating Payoffs:
      =image_tag  "investment_education/Options-Advanced3.png"
      %p
        Buyers of option contracts need to pay for the option premium. Thus, the appropriate payoffs for buyers of option contracts can be calculated as follows:
      %ol
        %li Call option: Rs. Max [0, V – X] - Rs.C, where C is the call option premium
        %li Put Option: Rs. Max [0, V – X] - Rs.P, where P is the put option premium
      %p The payoff for the seller of an option will be the exactly opposite of that of his buyer. This makes sense because the seller has an obligation to the buyer. A call option seller has the obligation to sell the underlying stock to the buyer at the strike price if the buyer exercises the call option.
    %section
      %h1 Trading Positions: The Long and Short of it:
      %p
      %ol
        %li Long position: When one buys an options contract, one is said to have a “long” position in the option
        %li Short position: When one sells an options contract, one is said to have a “short”position in the option.
    %section
      %h1 Option Payoff Diagrams:
      %p Again, we assume the following: Rs.V represents the value of an underlying stock on the date at which the option contract is exercised and Rs.X represents the strike price as indicated on the option contract. Rs.C is the call option premium and Rs.P is the put option premium.
      =image_tag  "investment_education/Options-Advanced4.png"
      =image_tag  "investment_education/Options-Advanced5.png"
      %p The buyer will only exercise his call option if the value of the stock price rises above the strike price i.e. he will be able to buy an expensive stock for a relatively low price. His breakeven point is Rs. (X + C).
      %p The payoff diagram for the call option seller will be exactly opposite of that of his buyer.
      %p An interesting point to note here is that in theory, the stock price may rise to infinity. The payoff for a call option buyer may rise to positive infinity while a call option seller may see losses that extend to infinity as well.
      =image_tag  "investment_education/Options-Advanced6.png"
      =image_tag  "investment_education/Options-Advanced7.png"
      %p Refer to the payoff diagram for the put option buyer: Since the buyer will receive Rs.X by exercising his right to sell as well as incur a cost of Rs.P by investing in the put option, his highest payoff is Rs.(X – P). His maximum loss is Rs.P if he does not exercise his option. The buyer will only exercise his put option if the value of the stock price falls below the strike price of Rs.X i.e. he will be able to sell a cheap stock at a high price.
      %p The payoff diagram for the put option seller will be exactly opposite of that of his buyer.

        %li The risk-return profile of a mutual fund depends on the securities it invests in.
