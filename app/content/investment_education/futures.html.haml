      %h1 What are futures?
      %p
        Futures are legally-binding contracts that give the buyer the right and the obligation to buy a pre-determined
        asset at a pre-determined price at a pre-determined time. Conversely, the seller has the right and the obligation
        to deliver that pre-determined asset at that pre-determined price at that pre-determined time.
      %p The pre-determined aka underlying assets can be stocks, bonds, baskets of stocks, commodities, etc.
      %p Futures are very much similar to #{link_to 'forwards', page_path('investment_education/forwards')}; however, there are also some notable characteristics that makes a futures contract different from a forward contract.
    %section
      %h1 Terminology:
      %h1 Long Position
      %p When an investor enters into a contract to buy a certain asset at a certain market determined price, he is said to take the long position in that contract.
      %h1 Short Position
      %p When an investor enters into a contract to sell a certain asset at a certain price, he is said to take the short position in that contract.
      %h1 Market to Market (MTM)
      %p
        The process by which the value of holding a given futures contract at that particular moment of time is determined. This value of a contract is the
        money that were to be gained or lost if the contract were to be settled at that moment. This is usually done on a daily basis by the exchange.
        The gains or losses from marking to market are immediately credited (or deducted) from the investors’ accounts.
      %p For example, if an investor were holding a long position a futures contract on ABC Stock at Rs. 714 and the market price of ABC stock were Rs.720, she would gain Rs.6 in the process of marking to market. This amount would immediately be credit to his/her account.
      %h1 Initial Margin
      %p This is the amount of money that investors have to deposit as a performance guarantee in order to open a futures position. This amount is determined by the exchange and is typically about 10-15% of the value of the futures contract.
      %h1 Maintenance Margin
      %p
        This is the minimum amount of money, as a percentage of the contract’s value, which
        investors have to put up in their account as a performance guarantee. If investors lose money during the process of
        marking to market and their account margin falls below the maintenance margin, a margin call is triggered and they will have to deposit more money in their accounts.
      %h1 Expiration
      %p The day the contract expires.
    %section
      %h1 Trading of futures:
      %p
        Like stocks, futures are traded on exchanges. The exchange regulates the specifications of the futures contracts and their trade. The exchange also acts as the counterparty in the case of the buyer as well as the seller of the futures contract, i.e. buyers buy futures contracts from the exchange and sellers sell these contracts to the exchange.
        This virtually eliminates the risk of default as far as the buyers and sellers are concerned.
    %section
      %h1 Modalities:
      =image_tag  "investment_education/tax3.png"
      %p
        Futures prices are market determined and there is usually no fee required to take a position (unlike options). Futures can also be rolled over to a later date as long as all margin requirements are met.
        Futures give investors leverage as they expose investors to large possible changes in the value of their position with small amounts of initial capital. Leverage serves to multiply gains as well as losses.
      %p
        For example, in order to gain exposure to the movement in price of 1000 shares of PQR Corp, trading at Rs.10 per share, an investor could spend Rs.10,000 and buy 1000 shares.
        A 5% increase in the share price of PQR would give him a profit of Rs.500, i.e. 5% of his initial investment. This is the traditional way of investing.
      %p
        However, if the same investor were to enter into a futures contract, he would only have to put up the initial margin which is say,
        10% of the value of the contract, i.e. Rs.1000. The same 5% increase in price of the underlying shares would give him the same
        profit, i.e. Rs.500. However, this is 50% of his initial investment. Unfortunately, this is true even for losses. A 5% fall in
        the price of the underlying shares would also cause a loss of 5% to the stock investor by a loss of 50% to the futures investor.
      %p
        Assume that two investors (Raj and Ravi) decide to enter into an oil futures contract on Day 1
        with the current oil spot price at Rs.70 per barrel. The futures contract has a size of 1000. Thus, the contract is
        worth Rs.70,000 today as it represents 100 barrels of oil. However, their brokers allow them to invest with an initial
        margin of 7.14% (Rs.5,000) with a maintenance margin of 5.71%(Rs.4,000).
      %p On Day 2, the futures price closes at Rs.80.
      %p Raj’s payoff : ( Rs.80 - Rs. 70) X 1000 = Rs. 10,000 (profit)
      %p Raj’s Day 2 broker account : Rs. 5000 + Rs. 10,000 = Rs.15,000
      %p Ravi’s payoff : (Rs. 70 - Rs. 80) X 1000 = - Rs. 10,000 (loss)
      %p Ravi’s Day 2 broker account : Rs. 5000 - Rs.10,000 = - Rs.5,000
      %p Since Ravi’s account has fallen below Rs. 4000, he needs to deposit more money into his account or the broker will forcibly close his position.
      %p As we have seen, trading in futures allows investors to rake in huge profits, as well as rack up huge losses. Investors are advised to have an in-depth understanding of the financial markets before investing in futures.
    %section
      %h1 How individual investors can invest in futures
      %p Investors can open futures positions through a broker. The broker would then give them access to futures traded on exchanges.
      %h1 Advantages
      %ol
        %li Futures give investors leverage and can thus be used to achieve large gains with small amounts of capital.
        %li The exchange is the counterparty to all futures transactions and thus, there is virtually no credit risk involved.
        %li Futures can be used for speculation as well as hedging.
      %h1 Disadvantages
      %ol
        %li The leverage that futures contracts give investors is also their biggest disadvantage. Investors can potentially lose more money than they had initially invested.
        %li The marking to market feature of futures can potentially impose severe cash-flow pressure on investors.
      %h1 Risks
      %ol
        %li This biggest risk of entering futures contracts is the risk arising from large amounts of leverage. Small fluctuations in the price of the underlying assets could result in large losses.
        %li If investors are not able to meet margin calls, their positions are liquidated. One way to minimize this risk is to over-collateralize the futures position.

      %p In a futures contract, the buyer usually does not take delivery of the physical asset, rather, the contract is cash-settled.
      %p Example: Assume that Victor Romanoff buys a Rs.70 three-month futures position on a barrel of oil. The seller, Gregory Brown has a short position on the contract. He therefore  promises to deliver the barrel of oil to the buyer after three months.
      %p Now assume that at the end of three months, the barrel of oil is valued at Rs.80. In a futures contract, the buyer does not actually collect the barrel of oil but obtains his payment in terms of cash. This means that he collects the difference between the price at which he entered into the contract and the prevailing market price i.e. Rs.80-Rs.70 = Rs.10 in cash from the seller. The buyer has thus, made a profit of Rs.80 - Rs.70 = Rs.10. The seller pays the buyer Rs.80, incurring a loss of Rs.10.
      %p Of course, futures positions can also be closed by delivering the underlying asset (as in a forward contract) using something called the delivery option.
      %p In futures trading, there will always be a “winning” and a “losing” position. Both the buyer and the seller will always take opposite positions. In the example above, the buyer is the “winner” and the seller, the “loser”.
      =image_tag  "investment_education/Futures-Advanced2.png"
      %h1 Customization:
      %p Futures contracts are typically traded on a futures exchange. Futures contracts are usually and their specifications such as the expiry date and lot-size set by the exchange. In Singapore, the typical lot-  size is 100, meaning that the futures contract will represent 100 spot assets. Buyers must thus, buy in multiples of 100 futures. (For example, it is not possible to buy 101 futures.) It is advisable for investors to be aware of contract sizes before they begin trading futures. A forward contract, on the other hand, is negotiable in terms of contract size.
      %h1 Daily marking-to-market of contract value:
      %p Futures contracts are electronic contracts that are traded on a futures exchange, which has a proper clearing house that updates their values daily. Forward contracts are not marked-to-market daily.
      %h1 Collateral:
      %p The futures exchange will ensure that futures traders do not default on their payments. The prices of futures are constantly changing throughout market opening hours so if the exchange finds that a trader exceeds a certain loss limit on his position, he will be required to deposit more money to into his account.

    %section
      %h1 What determines futures prices?
      %h1 Carrying costs:
      %p Take for example; you want to invest in oil so you decide to buy 1000 barrels of oil. However, once the physicals have been delivered to you, you will need to find a place to store all these barrels! In buying a futures contract, you can save on the costs of storage.
      %h1 Interest Rates:
      %p Buying a single futures contract entitles the investor to take delivery of the specific amount of spot assets as stated on the contract. Assume that a futures contract entitles the buyer to take delivery of 100 spot assets at the end of the holding period. Therefore, instead of having to pay for the 100 spot assets, the buyer will only need to pay for a single futures contract.
      =image_tag  "investment_education/Futures-Advanced4.png"
      %p The money freed up can be used to earn interest from other investments, for example, a risk-free deposit.
      %p In this sense, investing in futures is more advantageous than buying spot assets.
      %p
        Dividend yield:
        By holding a futures contract instead of the actual spot assets, an investor will not be able to collect dividends from the spot assets during the holding period of the contract. This effect only applies to futures that are tied to underlying assets that pay out dividends, such as stocks.
      %p
        Convenience benefits:
        Assume that you run a shipping firm. In an industry such as shipping, timeliness is extremely important to clients, and you will not want to make your customers wait. Thus, it will be good to have some oil on hand in case of emergencies. In this sense, holding futures does not provide such convenience benefits.
      %p
        Traders and investors:
        in the market will price in the carrying costs, opportunity, convenience benefits and dividend yield effects along with on their perceptions of real economic conditions.
        The futures price will be determined by movements in spot prices, carrying costs, interests rates, convenience benefits and dividend yields as shown by the following equation:
      %p Futures Price = Spot Price x (1 + carrying cost + interest rate – monetary value of convenience benefits - dividend yield)
      %p Note that the dual effects of carrying costs and interest rates will tend to cause futures to be more expensive than their underlying spot assets while convenience benefits and dividend yields will have the opposite effect.
    %section
      %h1 Trading Positions:
      %p There are two trading positions an investor can take in futures trading. The diagram below shows the payoff curve for the buyer of a futures contract and the seller.
      =image_tag  "investment_education/Futures-Advanced6.png"
      =image_tag  "investment_education/Futures-Advanced7.png"
      %h1 The Long and Short
      %p Most investors trade futures to hedge their risks or speculate on the possibility of price movements. Assume that a barrel of oil costs Rs.70 today.
      %p A ship-owner, Raj needs to buy oil as fuel for his ship. He has a natural short position on oil. He is better off if the barrel of oil falls in price. However, if he thinks that the barrel of oil will become more expensive in three months, he will buy a futures contract to hedge this risk. Thus, he buys a three-month futures contract at Rs.70 per barrel of oil to hedge against the risk of increasing oil prices.
      %p Ravi, an oil company executive, sells Raj the futures contract. He has a natural long position on the barrel of oil since his company produces oil. Ravi promises to deliver the barrel of oil at the end of three months. He is said to be short on the futures contract.
      %p As we have seen, the buyer and seller of futures contracts will take opposite positions in the contracts.
    %section
      %h1 Hedging using Futures:
      =image_tag  "investment_education/Futures-Advanced9.png"
      %p Assume that the price of the barrel of oil increases to Rs.80 in three months. Raj would have made a profit of Rs.10 by investing in a futures contract because instead of purchasing oil from the market for Rs.80, he can receive the same thing for only Rs.70 as stated on the futures contract. Thus, Raj is better off now that the barrel of oil has increased in price.
      %p The case is opposite for Ravi. He has made a loss by selling Raj the futures contract. At the end of three months, instead of selling his oil in the market for Rs.80, he has to deliver it to his buyer who will pay him only Rs.70. He has made a loss of Rs.10. By investing in futures, Ravi is worse off now that the barrel of oil has decreased in price.
      %p An interesting point to note here is that in hedging risks, oil producers will sell futures contracts while oil-consuming companies such as shipping companies will buy futures contracts.
      %p When any futures contract is being traded, there will always be a buyer and seller. Unless the futures price at the end of the holding period is equal to the price when both parties first entered into the contract, there will always be a winner and a loser since the buyer and seller will always have opposite positions.
      %p Futures prices change every day as the spot prices, interest rates and dividend yields change. The futures price will converge to equal the spot price as maturity date approaches.
