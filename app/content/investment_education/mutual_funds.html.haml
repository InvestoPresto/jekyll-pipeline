      %h1 What is a mutual fund?
      =image_tag  "investment_education/MF1.png"
      %p
        Simply put, a mutual fund is a financial institution that pools money from all its
        investors and invests it in a basket of securities. This basket may include a mix
        of assets like #{link_to 'stocks', page_path('investment_education/stocks')}, #{link_to 'bonds', page_path('investment_education/bonds')}, short-term money market instruments and other securities.
        The mutual fund raises capital through the issue of shares to investors in a process
        called a New Fund Offer (NFO). The fund is managed by an individual called the Fund
        Manager. The fund then invests this capital in different types of assets as per
        the objective of the fund as outlined in the prospectus issued to investors. The
        mutual fund investors therefore, indirectly own the assets of the mutual fund by
        owning pieces of the mutual fund. The net proceeds or losses are then distributed
        among investors annually.

      %h1 Fun Facts!
      %p
        The term “mutual fund” was created because of the idea of “mutual ownership” of
        the fund assets between the fund and its investors.
    %section
      %h1 Types of Assets owned by the Fund:
      %p
        Most mutual funds are equity funds, i.e. they invest in stocks. However, several
        mutual funds invest in corporate #{link_to 'bonds', page_path('investment_education/bonds')}, #{link_to 'commodities', page_path('investment_education/commodities')} or a combination of all of these.
        For example, the Fidelity Equity-Income fund aims to invest 80% of its portfolio
        in shares of large-cap American companies while the SBI Magnum Midcap fund aims
        to invest predominantly in a well diversified basket of shares of Midcap companies
        in India. Investors will know beforehand, which asset classes the fund invests in
        as the target asset allocation and the type of investments considered will be outlined
        in the prospectus. 
    %section
      %h1 Net Asset Value (NAV):
      %p
        Net Asset Value of a mutual fund is the total market value of all the assets owned
        by the fund minus the total market value of all the liabilities of the fund divided
        by the total number of shares issued by the fund. In other words, it is the per-share
        value of the fund. For example, if ABC mutual fund owns shares of several companies
        totaling 5 million US$ and owes its employees, salaries totaling Rs.500,000 and has
        issued 1 million shares since its inception, its net asset value is 4.5 per share
      %p
        NAV = (Total MV of all assets – Total MV of all liabilities)/Shares issued
      %p
        The NAV of funds are marked-to-market daily, meaning that they are calculated daily
        at close and investors will then trade at this closing price. Investors can place
        orders throughout the day to buy or sell shares in the fund. However, all orders
        will transact at the same price when the NAV has been calculated at close. This
        is known as “forward-pricing”.
    %section
      %h1 Open ended and Closed ended Mutual Funds:
      =image_tag  "investment_education/MF2.png"
      %h1 Open ended funds
      %p
        are mutual funds that do no limit the number of shares issued by them. In other
        words, shares of the open ended mutual funds can be issued and redeemed by the fund.
        The investors of open ended funds transact directly with the fund. New investors
        who would like to invest in the fund are issued new shares by the fund. Investors
        who want to disinvest from the fund receive cash from the fund after redemption
        of their shares.
      %h1 Closed Ended Funds:
      %p
        These are mutual funds who limit
        the number of shares issued by them. After the NFO, investors who want to invest
        in closed ended funds have to buy shares of the fund from existing investors of
        the fund. The fund does not normally issue new shares after the NFO. Closed end
        funds typically trade at a discount to NAV.
    %section
      %h1 Fun Facts!
      %p In the case of closed end funds, the numbers of shares are fixed. As investors lack information on the true value of the fund, they will only be willing to pay less than its actual value and hence, more often than not, closed end funds will trade at a discount to NAV. This is an inherent problem in free markets known as information asymmetry.

      %h1 Advantages:
      %ol
        %li 
          Diversification: Investing in mutual funds is a relatively cheap way of diversifying. By owning shares in a mutual fund instead of individual stocks, one’s risk can be spread out. This is because every share in a mutual fund represents a basket of securities and the loss on any particular security can be offset by gains in the other securities.
        %li 
          Economies of Scale: Depending on the fund objective and structure, it could also provide economies of scale. A mutual fund buys and sells
          huge amounts of securities at a time, thus its transaction costs per security will
          be far lower than what an individual will pay for each security. For example, for
          a person wanting to invest $100 in telecom companies in USA, it would be far easier
          and cheaper to buy 10 shares of XYZ Telecom mutual fund than buy 1 share of AT&T,
          1 share of Verizon and so on.
        %li 
          Affordability: A mutual fund allows individuals to invest in securities that would have been out-of-reach for them if they had chosen to invest individually.
        %p
          For example, money markets transact in extremely large denominations such that only
          institutional investors are able to trade them directly. An individual investor
          can choose to invest in money markets indirectly through a money market mutual fund
    %section
      %h1 Disadvantages:
      =image_tag  "investment_education/mf5.png", :width => "280px", :height => "133px"
      %ol
        %li 
          Professional Management: The financial expertise of professional fund managers
          is often questionable. In fact, index funds under passive fund management have often
          been able to deliver more favorable returns than actively managed mutual funds.
        %li 
          Costs:
          Mutual funds often charge entry and exit loads i.e. one time fees
          to issue and redeem of shares. This money goes to the fund and is often used for
          marketing and sales activities. These loads typically amount to about 1-3% of the
          investment. Thus, investors who invest Rs.100 in mutual funds typically only end up
          getting shares worth Rs.97. Funds also charge Management fees and/or other fees which
          typically amount to 1-1.5% p.a. This cost too is borne by the investor. More often
          than not, actual returns from the basket of securities as represented by a mutual
          fund may be wiped out by the sheer amounts of transactions costs and other fees
          imposed by the mutual fund.
      %p
        The emergence of No-Load mutual funds is a big step in towards eliminating such
        unnecessary expense for the investors. Several funds, especially Exchange Traded
        Funds (ETFs) now have low expense ratios, typically less than 1% p.a. Investors
        can consider investing in such funds.
    %section
      %h1 What is the risk-return profile of mutual funds?
      =image_tag  "investment_education/MF3.png"
      %p
        The risk-return profile of a mutual fund depends heavily on the fund’s objective, the asset classes
        it invests in and the type of securities it invests in. An asset class is a group of securities that exhibit similar characteristics and behave similarly in the market.The bottom line is that a mutual fund has the same risk profile as the securities that it invests in.
      %p Equity mutual funds carry the risk profile of equity securities while bond funds carry the risks of #{link_to 'bonds', page_path('investment_education/bonds')} and so on. Midcap funds are generally more risky than large cap funds while money market funds are usually the safest. Since most mutual funds invest in a well diversified basket of securities, the risk carried by such funds is much lower than the risk from investing in a single security.
    %section
      %h1 Types of Mutual Funds:
      %h1 Equity Funds
      %p Invest in equity securities i.e. shares. They may also invest in stock options, futures etc. Equity funds may focus on investment style such as Value/ Growth funds or on specific sectors such as Infrastructure, Automobiles, Telecom etc. Mid-cap funds invest in mid-market capitalization companies while small cap funds invest in companies with small market capitalization.Similarly, Emerging market funds invest in companies from emerging markets such as India, Russia, Brazil etc.
      %h1 Bond Funds
      %p Invest in a basket of corporate bonds. Bond funds provide #{link_to 'diversification', page_path('investment_education/diversification')} benefits and reduce the total credit risk borne by the investor.
      %h1 Balanced Funds
      %p Invest in a combination of equity and debt instruments i.e. #{link_to 'shares', page_path('investment_education/stocks')} and #{link_to 'bonds', page_path('investment_education/bonds')}.
      %h1 Funds of funds
      %p (FoF) ) are mutual funds that invest in other mutual funds. This may be suitable for investors who are unable to determine their own asset allocation model.
      =image_tag  "investment_education/mf10.png", :width => "500px"
      %p This is also a good choice for investors who wish to enter into a variety of emerging markets. Fund of funds could invest in hedge funds from these emerging markets rather than pick out individual securities themselves. This is because funds of funds do not have intimate knowledge of these markets but still want exposure to their growth potential. Therefore, it may be better for them to invest with the aid of hedge fund managers who have experience investing in these markets.
      %p Hedge funds choose securities based on their expertise and the funds of funds invest in reputed hedge funds.
      %p A disadvantage of this is that an investor may end up paying multiple layers of costs. Investors ultimately bear transaction costs and the management fees charged by in investee hedge funds as well as the fund of funds. These fees could add up to several hundred basis points and should be taken into consideration before making decisions about investing in funds of funds.
      =image_tag  "investment_education/mf9.png", :width => "500px"
      %p
        The main risk that investors in mutual funds face is, market risk
        i.e. the risk that the prices of the assets that the mutual fund invests in, fall due to changes in market conditions thereby reducing the Net Asset Value of the fund.
      %p
        Note that unsystematic risk (The risk that fluctuations in the prices of individual stocks/bonds due to company specific reasons will affect the NAV), is virtually nil. This is due to #{link_to 'diversification', page_path('investment_education/diversification')} benefits.
        Investors also bear the risk that the fund manager will deviate from the fund’s stated objective thereby distorting returns. This risk is called manager risk. Investors in funds that invest outside their home country also bear currency risk(The risk that changes in exchange rates distort returns).
      %h1 How can one invest in mutual funds?
      %p Investors can approach funds directly or use the services of a broker(e.g. Charles Schwab or E-Trade) in order to buy shares of mutual funds. Most brokers charge a brokerage fee for enabling you to buy no load funds or exchange traded funds.
